## 🏗️ The 3-Layer Architecture

PM OS is built on three interconnected layers:

### Layer 1: BCGPT (Data)
- **Purpose:** Read data from Basecamp
- **Technology:** Node.js MCP Server
- **Capabilities:** 291 tools, deep integration
- **Docs:** [bcgpt/](bcgpt/)

### Layer 2: Flow (Execution)
- **Purpose:** Execute actions across 200+ platforms
- **Technology:** Activepieces
- **Capabilities:** Universal automation, workflows
- **Docs:** [flow/](flow/)

### Layer 3: PMOS (Intelligence)
- **Purpose:** Analyze, predict, decide, orchestrate
- **Technology:** AI, ML, Agents
- **Capabilities:** Health scoring, predictions, autonomous agents
- **Docs:** [pmos/](pmos/)

**Together:** They create the world's first AI-powered operating system for project managers.

## 🤝 Contributing to Docs

When adding documentation:

1. **Identify the layer** (BCGPT, Flow, PMOS, or System)
2. **Place in correct folder** (see structure above)
3. **Update [DOCS_INDEX.md](DOCS_INDEX.md)**
4. **Update layer README** if needed
5. **Cross-link** related documents

See [REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md](REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md) for details on the new structure.
