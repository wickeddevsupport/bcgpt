## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw gives you an **AI Team** - specialized agents that work 24/7:

- **Sales Agent** - Monitors leads, qualifies prospects, updates CRM
- **Project Manager** - Tracks deadlines, sends reminders, generates reports
- **Developer Agent** - Reviews code, monitors issues, deploys fixes
- **Support Agent** - Handles tickets, responds to queries
- **Custom Agents** - Create any agent you need

**Just describe what you need in plain language. The agents handle the rest.**

## How It Works

```
1. Sign up and connect your tools (Slack, Basecamp, GitHub, etc.)
2. Create agents or use pre-built templates
3. Tell agents what to do in plain language
4. Agents work autonomously and notify you when needed
```

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Autonomous Agents** | Work in background, notify when needed |
| **Natural Language** | Just type what you want |
| **Connect Once** | All agents share your connections |
| **Anti-Hallucination** | n8n workflows ensure real actions |
| **Workspace Isolation** | Your data is private to you |
