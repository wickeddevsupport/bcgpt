# OpenClaw - Personal AI Agent with Workflow Superpowers

> Product note: the current production workflow runtime is Activepieces / Flow.
> Some deeper implementation examples in this document still reflect earlier `n8n` planning and should be treated as conceptual background, not live deployment truth.

## The Vision

**OpenClaw is your personal AI agent that actually does things.** Not just chat - real actions, real workflows, real results. Powered by PMOS orchestration plus a dedicated workflow engine for deterministic execution and verified automation.

## User Journey

### Day 1: Setup

```
User signs up → Enters workspace name → Adds AI keys (BYOK) → Ready to go

No complex configuration. No workflow templates to choose. Just start talking.
```

### Day 2-7: Discovery

```
User: "What can you help me with?"

OpenClaw: "I can help you with:
- 📧 Email: Summarize, draft, auto-reply
- 📋 Tasks: Create, track, remind
- 📊 Reports: Generate, schedule, deliver
- 🔗 Connect: Link your tools (Basecamp, GitHub, Slack...)
- ⚡ Automate: Create workflows that run 24/7

What would you like to start with?"
```

### Day 30: Power User

```
User has:
- 5 active workflows running 24/7
- 3 specialized agents (Sales, Support, Personal)
- 50+ automated tasks completed
- Zero manual repetitive work
```

## Anti-Hallucination Architecture

### The Problem with AI Agents

| Issue | Traditional AI | OpenClaw Solution |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Hallucination | AI makes up facts | n8n workflows use real APIs |
| Unreliable Actions | AI forgets or misinterprets | Workflows are deterministic |
| No Audit Trail | Can't verify what happened | Every workflow execution logged |
| Context Loss | Long conversations drift | Workflow state persists |
| Tool Integration | AI pretends to use tools | n8n actually calls APIs |

### How n8n Prevents Hallucinations

### Key Principle: AI Plans, n8n Executes

| AI Role | n8n Role |
|---------|----------|
| Understand intent | Execute deterministically |
| Generate workflow JSON | Run workflow steps |
| Explain results | Log every action |
| Handle exceptions | Retry on failure |
| Learn from feedback | Maintain state |

---

## Robustness Features

### 1. Workflow Verification

Before any workflow runs:

```
AI: "I'll create a workflow to sync Basecamp todos to GitHub issues.
     
     Here's what it will do:
     1. Watch for new todos in Basecamp project X
     2. Create matching issue in GitHub repo Y
     3. Add labels based on todo list name
     4. Post confirmation to Slack
     
     [Preview Workflow] [Edit] [Activate]"
```

User sees exactly what will happen before activation.

### 2. Execution Transparency

Every action is logged and visible:

```
Workflow: "Basecamp → GitHub Sync"
Last Run: 2 hours ago
Status: ✅ Success

Executed Steps:
├─ ✅ Basecamp: Found 3 new todos
├─ ✅ GitHub: Created issue #142 "Fix login bug"
├─ ✅ GitHub: Created issue #143 "Update docs"
├─ ✅ GitHub: Created issue #144 "Add tests"
└─ ✅ Slack: Posted summary to #dev

[View Details] [Edit Workflow] [Pause]
```

### 3. Graceful Failure Handling

```
Workflow: "Daily Report"
Last Run: 5 minutes ago
Status: ⚠️ Partial Success

Executed Steps:
├─ ✅ Database: Fetched 50 records
├─ ✅ Transform: Generated report
├─ ❌ Email: SMTP timeout (will retry in 5 min)
└─ ⏳ Slack: Pending (waiting for email)

[Retry Now] [View Error] [Edit]
```

### 4. Rollback Capability

```
"Oops, that workflow created 100 duplicate issues!"

OpenClaw: "I can undo the last 5 workflow executions:
          
          2 hours ago: Created 3 GitHub issues
          4 hours ago: Created 2 GitHub issues
          6 hours ago: Created 5 GitHub issues
          
          [Undo Last Run] [Undo All] [Keep As Is]"
```

### 5. Confidence Scoring

AI shows confidence level for each action:

```
User: "Summarize last week's sales calls"

OpenClaw: "I found 12 sales calls from last week.
          
          Confidence: 85%
          ⚠️ 2 calls might be internal meetings (unclear from title)
          
          Summary:
          - 8 product demos scheduled
          - 3 follow-ups needed
          - 1 pricing discussion
          
          [View Sources] [Regenerate] [Edit]"
```

---

## User-Friendly Features

### 1. Natural Language Everything

```
"Create a workflow that..."
"When a customer emails..."
"Every Monday at 9am..."
"If the ticket is urgent..."
"Summarize all meetings from..."
```

No technical jargon required. AI translates to n8n workflows.

### 2. Smart Suggestions

```
OpenClaw notices you manually:
- Forward emails to the same person 5 times
- Create similar GitHub issues
- Post the same Slack updates

Suggestion: "I noticed you keep forwarding emails to Sarah.
Would you like me to automate this?"

[Yes, Create Workflow] [No, Thanks] [Not Now]
```

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

Simple at first, powerful when needed:

```
Level 1: Just chat - "Send weekly report"
Level 2: View workflow - See what's happening
Level 3: Edit workflow - Modify parameters
Level 4: Advanced - Full n8n canvas access
```

### 4. Contextual Help

```
User: "Connect to Salesforce"

OpenClaw: "I can help you connect to Salesforce.
          
          What would you like to do?
          - Sync contacts
          - Create leads from emails
          - Generate reports
          
          Or I can show you all Salesforce capabilities."
```

### 5. Learning from Corrections

```
User: "That's not right, the project ID is 12345, not 1234"

OpenClaw: "Got it! I've updated the workflow to use project ID 12345.
          I'll remember this for future workflows with this project.
          
          [Updated Workflow] [Test Now]"
```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Parallel Execution

```
User: "Prepare for my Monday"

OpenClaw dispatches to multiple agents:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Personal Agent: Check calendar, block focus time            │
│ Email Agent: Summarize unread, flag urgent                  │
│ Reports Agent: Compile weekend metrics                      │
│ Integration Agent: Sync all tools, check for issues         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

All run in parallel. Results consolidated in 30 seconds.
```

### Agent Memory

Each agent remembers:

```
Agent: Personal Agent
Memory:
- Prefers morning meetings (9-11am)
- Always includes Zoom link
- CCs assistant on external emails
- Uses bullet points for summaries
- Prefers concise responses

This agent learns your preferences over time.
```
