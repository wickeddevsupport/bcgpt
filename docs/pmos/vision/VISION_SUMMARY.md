## 🎯 What We're Building

**PM OS** is not a project management tool. It's an **operating system for project managers** — a universal intelligence layer that sits on top of ANY platform (Basecamp, Jira, Asana, GitHub, etc.) and makes them intelligent.

### The Stack (Simplified by Activepieces)

**🎯 We only need ONE MCP server!**

### The Activepieces Game-Changer

**Activepieces is NOT just automation — it's why we don't need to build 20+ MCP servers!**

**🎯 The Development Strategy Changed:**

**Old Plan (Years of Work):**
- ❌ Build Jira MCP server (3-6 months)
- ❌ Build GitHub MCP server (3-6 months)
- ❌ Build Slack MCP server (2-4 months)
- ❌ Build Email MCP server (2-4 months)
- ❌ Build 20+ more MCP servers (years)
- ❌ Maintain all these servers forever

**New Plan (Months of Work):**
- ✅ Basecamp MCP server (done!)
- ✅ 200+ Activepieces pieces (free, already built, community-maintained!)
- 🔜 Build intelligence orchestration layer
- 🔜 Build natural language → flow generator
- 🔜 Build agent → workflow executor

**What Makes This Work:**

**200+ Activepieces Pieces = FREE Universal Integration Layer:**

| Category | Available Pieces (All FREE!) |
|----------|------------------------------|
| **Project Management** | Basecamp ✅, Jira, Asana, Monday, Linear, Trello, ClickUp, Notion, Todoist |
| **Development** | GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps |
| **Communication** | Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Telegram |
| **Email** | Gmail, Outlook, SendGrid, Mailchimp, Postmark |
| **Calendar** | Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, Calendly |
| **Data & Sheets** | Google Sheets, Airtable, Excel, CSV |
| **Documents** | Notion, Confluence, Google Docs, Dropbox, OneDrive |
| **AI** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, Stability AI |
| **CRM & Sales** | Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zendesk |
| **Payments** | Stripe, PayPal, Shopify |
| **Plus** | 170+ more pieces covering every major platform |

**Community-maintained** (new pieces added constantly)  
**Self-hosted** (we control it at flow.wickedlab.io)  
**Battle-tested** (production-ready, used by thousands)  
**Open source** (can extend with custom pieces)

**What Activepieces brings:**
- ✅ **200+ pre-built, FREE integrations** for every major platform
- ✅ **Visual flow builder** (no-code automation design)
- ✅ **Event-driven architecture** (webhooks, schedules, triggers, polling)
- ✅ **Cross-platform workflows** (Basecamp → Slack → GitHub → Email → 200+ platforms)
- ✅ **Custom pieces** (already have Basecamp piece, can build more)
- ✅ **Deployed & running** at flow.wickedlab.io

**How PM OS + Activepieces = Magic:**

```
PM OS Intelligence                  Activepieces Execution
─────────────────                   ──────────────────────
"Project X is at risk" ─────────►   Trigger: Slack alert to PM
                                    Action: Create todo for team lead
                                    Action: Update status dashboard

"New task needs triage" ────────►   Trigger: Analyze task description
                                    Action: Auto-assign based on skills
                                    Action: Post to relevant channel

"Sprint ending in 2 days" ──────►   Trigger: Generate retrospective
                                    Action: Post to message board
                                    Action: Create next sprint todos

"Sarah is at burnout risk" ─────►   Trigger: Notify manager privately
                                    Action: Redistribute workload
                                    Action: Block new assignments

Natural Language Request:           AI-Generated Activepieces Flow:
"When a card moves to Done,        [Trigger: Card status changed]
post a celebration message"        [Condition: Status = Done]
                                   [Action: Post to campfire]
                                   [Action: Add celebration emoji]
```

**The Game-Changing Combinations:**

1. **AI Decides, Activepieces Executes**
   - PM OS: "This project needs more resources"
   - Activepieces: Creates hiring request in HR system, notifies budget owner, adds placeholder people to project

2. **Cross-Platform Intelligence**
   - PM OS monitors Basecamp health score
   - Triggers Activepieces flow
   - Updates Jira, posts to Slack, logs to Notion, updates Google Sheet dashboard
   - **One intelligence layer controlling ALL platforms**

3. **Natural Language → Visual Workflow → Execution**
   - User: "Every Friday at 5pm, generate status report and email it to stakeholders"
   - PM OS: Parses intent, generates Activepieces flow JSON
   - Activepieces: Deploys flow, runs on schedule
   - **Zero-code automation from conversation**

4. **Bidirectional Enhancement**
   - Activepieces flows generate data → PM OS learns patterns
   - PM OS predicts needs → Activepieces flows satisfy them
   - **Self-improving automation ecosystem**

5. **Marketplace Synergy**
   - PM OS intelligence patterns (how to decide)
   - + Activepieces flow templates (how to execute)
   - = **Complete solutions users can install in one click**

**Example: Full Autonomous Workflow**

```
1. PM Agent (Intelligence)
   ↓ Observes: Project velocity dropped 40%
   ↓ Analyzes: Team is overloaded, 3 blockers
   ↓ Decides: Need to redistribute work + escalate blockers
   ↓
2. Activepieces (Execution)
   ↓ Flow 1: Redistributes tasks based on capacity
   ↓ Flow 2: Posts blocker summary to Slack with @mentions
   ↓ Flow 3: Creates escalation ticket in Jira
   ↓ Flow 4: Updates stakeholder dashboard
   ↓ Flow 5: Logs action for audit trail
   ↓
3. Human (Approval)
   ✓ Reviews proposed changes
   ✓ Approves in one click (or rolls back)
```

**This is the killer insight:**
- **Without Activepieces:** PM OS is smart but limited to its 291 Basecamp tools
- **With Activepieces:** PM OS can control the ENTIRE work stack — Slack, GitHub, Jira, Email, Calendar, Notion, Sheets, Airtable, Linear, 200+ platforms
- **Result:** Intelligence layer + Universal execution = **Operating system for ALL of work**

**Why This Strategy Wins:**

1. **Speed to Market**: Months instead of years (no need to build 20+ MCP servers)
2. **Maintenance Burden**: Activepieces community maintains the pieces, we focus on intelligence
3. **Platform Coverage**: 200+ platforms immediately vs. 1 new platform every 3-6 months
4. **Cost**: FREE integrations vs. hiring team to build/maintain MCP servers
5. **Reliability**: Battle-tested pieces used by thousands vs. our custom code
6. **Future-Proof**: New platforms added by community automatically available to us
7. **Focus**: 100% effort on intelligence (our moat) vs. 90% effort on boring CRUD integrations

**What We Actually Need to Build:**

```
✅ Already Built:
  • Basecamp MCP Server (291 tools)
  • Activepieces deployment (flow.wickedlab.io)
  • 200+ platform pieces (free from Activepieces)

🔜 Wave 1-2 (Foundation):
  • Intelligence <-> Activepieces orchestration layer
  • MCP tools to trigger/manage Activepieces flows
  • Webhook bridge (Basecamp events → Activepieces triggers)

🔜 Wave 3 (Intelligence):
  • Natural language → Activepieces flow generator
  • AI flow optimizer
  • Cross-platform health monitoring

🔜 Wave 4 (Autonomy):
  • Autonomous agent → workflow executor
  • Agent decision → auto-generate + execute flows
  • Human approval + undo system

🔜 Wave 7 (Platform):
  • Marketplace (intelligence patterns + flow templates)
  • Community sharing
  • One-click solution installation
```

**The Strategic Moat:**

Our competitive advantage is NOT integrations (Activepieces provides that).  
Our competitive advantage IS **intelligence** (how to analyze, predict, decide, and orchestrate).

Anyone can connect platforms. Only we have intelligence that knows:
- When a project is at risk (before humans notice)
- How to optimize workload distribution
- What actions to take across 200+ platforms
- How to coordinate autonomous agents
- When to involve humans vs. auto-execute

**Activepieces is the execution engine. PM OS is the brain. Together = unstoppable.**
