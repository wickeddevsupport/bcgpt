# Documentation Backup

This folder contains archived documentation from previous iterations.

## What's Here

| Folder/File | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `bcgpt/` | Original BCGPT documentation (API coverage, audits, phases) |
| `flow/` | Flow/Activepieces integration docs (now replaced by n8n) |
| `pmos/` | PMOS vision documents (features catalog, patterns) |
| `system/` | System architecture and deployment docs |
| `00-START-HERE.md` | Old start document |
| `MULTI_USER_FLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md` | Multi-user flow architecture |
| `NAVIGATION_MAP.md` | Old navigation map |
| `OPENCLAW_ANALYSIS.md` | OpenClaw analysis |
| `REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` | Previous reorganization notes |
| `README_OLD.md` | Previous README |

## Why Backup?

These documents were archived on **2026-02-17** during documentation cleanup.

The new streamlined documentation is in the parent `docs/` folder with:
- Clear product vision
- Actionable next steps
- Technical integration guides

## Still Relevant?

Some content in these backups may still be useful for reference:
- `pmos/vision/FEATURES_CATALOG.md` - Feature ideas
- `system/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Server setup
- `bcgpt/reference/TOOL_MATRIX.md` - Tool coverage

If you need to restore anything, copy it back to the main docs folder and update.
